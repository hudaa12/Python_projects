1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

As a user
So that I can improve my grammar
I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

2. Design the Function Signature
Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

text: starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark
. ! ? 
start with caps 
return verify True or False
side effect: not printing 

3. Create examples:

Given a text of "Hello, there!"
Returns = True 


Given a text of "hi, what is your name"
Return = False 


Given a text of "hello world!"
Return = False 


Given a text of "Hello world,"
Return = False 


4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.

Here's an example for you to start with:
